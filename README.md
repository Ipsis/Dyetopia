Railcraft for ideas on how to sync the GUI update messages for tanks.

#Code From Other Project
This mod uses a small number of classes from other mods.
## CoFH
[https://github.com/CoFH/ThermalFoundation]
The following classes are based off:

* BlockFluidDYT -> BlockFluidCoFHBase

[https://github.com/CoFH/CoFHCore]

The following classes are based off:

* TabEnergy -> TabEnergy from CoFHCore
* TabInfo -> TabInfo from CoFHCore

The following classed are copied:

* IconRegistry
* TabScrolledText

I think I based the fluid textures on the ThermalFoundation ones, but I'm no longer sure!

## Pahimar
[EE3 Repository](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3)

The following classed are copied:

* LogHelper.java
